Overview (Community Property),"Nevada is a community property state. If a valid marriage exists, anything acquired by the partners during marriage is presumed to be community property. Separate property is property owned before marriage, or acquired during marriage with separate property funds, or acquired by gift, will or inheritance if one partner was named as the beneficiary. Community property belongs to the community, and each spouse has an equal, undivided, half-interest in the community. A spouse claiming that property presumed to be community property is actually his or her separate property has the burden of proving by clear and convincing evidence that the property is actually his or her separate property."
Surviving Spouse Share,"If a spouse survives his other spouse, he inherits the entire community."
