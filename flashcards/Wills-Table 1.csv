Codicil,Codicil is an amendment to will and must be executed with will formalities.
Doctrine of Republication by Codicil,"The doctrine of republication by codicil states that the entire will is deemed to be executed on date of the last codicil. Revocation of the will revokes all codicil, but revocation of a codicil does not revoke the will."
Will Contest,"A will contest must be filed within three months of the will being admitted into probate. A contest must be made with someone with standing, which is an interested party with an economic interest that would be adversely affected by the will."
Lack of Testamentary Capacity,"A lack of testamentary capacity requires showing by contestants by a preponderance of the evidence that 1) the testator be at least 18 years old, 2) the testator understands the nature of the act he was doing, 3) the testator understand the nature and character of his property, and 4) the testator know the natural objects of his bounty"

Forfeiture Clause,"As long as contestant has probable cause and brings the suit in good faith, he will not have his rights forfeited; however if the suit is spurious, then it is enforceable."
Revocation of Will,"A will may be revoked by 1) a subsequent, valid testamentary instrument or 2) by physical act to the will. If the will is lost a contestant must show 1) that the will was in legal existence, 2) the cause of the will’s non-production and 3) either a copy of the will or testimony of two witnesses who have read it or heard it read."
Dependent Relative Revocation,The dependent relative revocation permits a court to disregard an act of revocation that 1) is premised or dependent upon a mistake of law or fact as to the validity of another disposition and 2) but for the mistake the testator would not have made the revocation
Automatic Revival of Revoked Will,"If a subsequent will that invalidated an original will becomes invalidated, the original will is not valid unless it is executed again."
Incorporation by Reference,"A writing that is not part of the will and was not present when the will was executed can be incorporated by reference to the will if 1) the writing was in existence when the will was executed, 2) the will manifests intent to incorporate the writing and 3) the will describes the writing sufficiently to permit its identification."
Tangible Personal Property,"A will may refer to written statement or list that disposes tangible personal property, not stocks or real estate, not specifically disposed of by the will.

Lapse,A gift lapses if a beneficiary predeceases the testator unless it is saved by the anti-lapse statute or a residuary clause.
Anti-Lapse statute,Anti-lapse statute requires 1) predeceasing beneficiary to be a relative of the testator and 2) predeceasing beneficiary left descendants who survived the testator.
Lapse in Residuary Clause,"If the residuary estate is devised to two or more persons and the gift to one of them fails for any reason, the surviving residuary devises take the entire residuary estate in proportion to their interests in the residue. However, if the gift could have been subject to the anti-lapse statute, the anti-lapse statute trumps."
Simultaneous Death,"When passage of title to property depends on priority of death, and there’s insufficient evidence to determine which person (testator and beneficiary) died otherwise that simultaneously. With wills, it is presumed the beneficiary predeceased the testator."
Abatement,"If assets are insufficient to cover the testator’s debts, debts and administration expenses are first paid out of intestate property, then residuary assets, then general and demonstrative legacies, then specific requests."
Ademption,"Ademption determines what happens when property bequeathed under a will is no longer in the testators estate at the time of death. Usually the gift fails, however if the beneficiary was to receive a specific bequest that was sold by the estate, the beneficiary is entitled to remaining sale proceeds."
Latent Ambiguities,To fix a latent ambiguity a contestant may introduce extrinsic evidence.
Pretermitted,Execution before an event. Such as a pretermitted spouse or child. A pretermitted person gets an intestate share unless the will specifically omits that person.
